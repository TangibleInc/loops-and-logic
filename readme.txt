Loops & Logic is a template system with content loops and conditions.

== Description ==

**Loops & Logic** is a toolset that allows you to have extensive control over the display of WordPress content & data on your site’s frontend for when your theme or builder doesn't have the options you need. This plugin gives you the power of custom PHP theme & builder module development using a simplified HTML-like syntax that will be familiar to any frontend developer.

=== Support ===

* Please see [our documentation site](https://loop.tangible.one/) for a complete description of plugin features.
* Support & discussions can be found on [our forum located here](https://discourse.tangible.one/).

=== Key Features ===

* Use HTML templates with dynamic tags like Loop, Field, and If
* Use theme location rules to apply **custom templates** to post types, taxonomies & more (similar to Beaver Themer or Elementor Theme Builder)
* Easily **enqueue** your CSS stylesheets and Javascript anywhere using a visual location rule builder
* Seamlessly write your CSS directly in **SASS** without worrying about compilation
* Create query **loops** of any content type, such as: posts, pages, custom post types, attachments, users, taxonomies and terms
* Display built-in and custom **fields**
* Build **logic** to display things based on certain conditions, for example: creating a menu, with some links only for logged-in users, or by user role
* Create custom shortcodes to display anything from a custom field to an entire dynamic-data driven web page

=== Example Usage ===

At the core of L&L is the ability to quickly and elegantly loop through WordPress data like in this example of displaying a list of links to the three most recent posts

``<ul>
``  <Loop type=post count=3 orderby=date order=desc>
``    <li>
``      <a href="{Field url}"><Field title /></a>
``    </li>
``  </Loop>
``</ul>

Accomplishing the same thing in PHP is a little more complex:

``<?php
``$args = array(
``    'post_type' => 'post',
``    'posts_per_page' => 3,
``    'orderby' => 'date',
``    'order' => 'DESC',
``);
``$query = new WP_Query( '$args' ); ?>
``<?php if ( $query->have_posts() ) : ?>
``  <ul>
``    <?php while ( $query->have_posts() ) : $query->the_post(); ?>
``
``      <li>
``        <a href="<?php the_permalink(); ?>">
``          <?php the_title(); ?>
``        </a>
``      </li>
``
``    <?php endwhile; ?>
``  </ul>
``<?php endif; ?>

It can be difficult to add PHP to your site if you're not a backend developer, but L&L is a breeze to include, even in a page builder layout.

Page builders like Gutenberg, Elementor, and Beaver Builder often have gaps in their capabilities that would normally require you to either develop a custom add-on or purchase a bloated add-on pack just to get the one element you need. L&L adds a template editor module directly to each builder so that you can simply describe what you want to display in L&L code and place it using the builder interface. You can even copy-paste your L&L code between page builders if you work with more than one! It's like having your own page builder addon factory.


=== Plugin & Theme Support ===

= Plugin Support: =

Loops & Logic works with the post types and custom fields added by most plugins, but plugins with special data structures like a custom tables or fields with data formats that need parsing require us to program explicit support.

= Bundled integrations: =

**✅ Advanced Custom Fields (ACF)**

L&L supports Advanced Custom Fields (ACF) field types in the core, allowing you to work with most of their field types out of the box! We also plan to support other WordPress custom field plugins such as Pods & Metabox in the future.

``<Loop acf_flexible=field_name>
``  <If field=layout value=layout_1>
``
``    Layout 1
``    <img src="{Field acf_image=field_name field=url}" />
``    <Field acf_editor=field_name />
``
``  <Else if field=layout value=layout_2 />
``
``    Layout 2
``    <Field acf_editor=field_name />
``    <img src="{Field acf_image=field_name field=url}" />
``
``  </If>
``</Loop>

**✅ WP Fusion**

The freely-included WP Fusion integration allows you to use conditional logic to protect or display different content based on a user's tags.

``<If user_field=wp_fusion_tags includes value="123">
``  User has tag ID 123
``<Else />
``  User does not have tag.
``</If>
